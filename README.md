🎬🔥 Netflix-Style Customer Churn Prediction
📉 Predicting Which Users Might Leave the Platform

I built this project as a fun machine learning experiment imagining myself as part of Netflix’s Data Science Team.
Just like my portfolio website project helped me grow in web development, this one helped me level up in machine learning, feature engineering, and data storytelling.

This wasn’t just a model…
It was a complete learning journey.

🚀 Project Motivation

I wanted to recreate how a big tech company like Netflix thinks about user behavior:

Who might stop using the platform?

Why do they churn?

What patterns make users stay longer?

How can data help predict these outcomes?

Using the IBM Telco Churn dataset, I redesigned the entire thing to feel like Netflix data.

🧠 My Approach

This project was my playground to explore:

ML pipeline building

Feature engineering creativity

Clean, structured analysis

Data visualization

Producing a polished notebook for GitHub

🎯 What I Worked On
⭐ Data Transformation (Netflix-Style)

I converted telecom-style columns into streaming-service style ones:

tenure → MonthsSubscribed

MonthlyCharges → MonthlySubscriptionFee

InternetService → StreamingQuality

Churn → Churned

And then I engineered one of the coolest features:

🎥 WatchHours

A synthetic feature representing user engagement, created using randomness + subscription duration.

This made the dataset feel exactly like Netflix internal data.

🧠 Skills I Developed During This Project
🧹 Data Cleaning & Wrangling

Handling missing data

Dropping irrelevant fields

Converting data types safely

Renaming & restructuring for clarity

📦 Feature Engineering

One-hot encoding

Synthetic feature creation

Mapping Yes/No to binary labels

Understanding how engineered features boost model accuracy

🤖 Model Building

Logistic Regression

Data splitting

Standard scaling

Evaluating precision, recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix interpretation

📊 Visualization

Confusion matrix heatmap

Sample data views

Clear notebook presentation

📈 Final Model Performance
🎉 Accuracy: ~80%+

This met my goal of achieving above 80% predictive quality.

📦 Confusion Matrix

Shows how well churners vs non-churners were identified.

🔍 Classification Report

Provides precision, recall, and F1-scores for deeper insight.

This model is simple, interpretable, and a great starting point for churn prediction in streaming platforms.
