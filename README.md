\# Netflix-Style Customer Churn Prediction 🎬📉



A fun machine learning project where I predict user churn as if I were analyzing data for \*\*Netflix\*\*.



I used the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset but renamed and engineered features to look like a streaming platform dataset (e.g., `MonthsSubscribed`, `MonthlySubscriptionFee`, `StreamingQuality`, `WatchHours`).



The goal was to create a \*\*simple, clean notebook\*\* with accuracy above \*\*80%\*\*, which can act as a starter churn model.

\## 📊 What the project does



\- Loads and cleans the dataset  

\- Renames telecom-style columns to Netflix-style  

\- Creates a synthetic engagement feature (`WatchHours`)  

\- Applies one-hot encoding  

\- Scales numerical features  

\- Trains a \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* model  

\- Prints:

&nbsp; - Accuracy (≈80%+)

&nbsp; - Confusion matrix  

&nbsp; - Classification report  

\- Plots a confusion matrix heatmap
