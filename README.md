🎬 Netflix-Style Customer Churn Prediction
Predicting which users might leave the platform using machine learning
🚀 Why I Built This Project

I created this project as a fun way to apply machine learning skills to a real-world scenario:
What if I built a churn prediction system for Netflix?

This was my opportunity to explore:

Practical ML workflows

Feature engineering

Data cleaning

Model evaluation

And presenting the results in a clean, professional notebook

I wanted the final model to achieve 80%+ accuracy, and it does.

🧠 Project Vision

I took the publicly available IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset and transformed it into a Netflix-like dataset by renaming features and engineering new ones such as:

MonthsSubscribed

MonthlySubscriptionFee

StreamingQuality

WatchHours (synthetic engagement metric)

The goal was not just accuracy but making the dataset feel like it came straight from a streaming service analytics team.

🛠️ What I Learned While Building This
📌 Machine Learning Workflow

Cleaning and preprocessing real-world data

Encoding categorical variables

Handling missing values

Scaling numerical features

Splitting into train/test sets

Training a classification model

Evaluating accuracy and understanding misclassifications

📌 Feature Engineering

Renaming telecom-style features into Netflix-style

Creating a new engagement feature: WatchHours

Understanding how engineered features impact prediction accuracy

📌 Data Visualization

Plotting a confusion matrix heatmap

Examining which categories impact churn

Presenting ML output clearly in Jupyter Notebook

📌 Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Final Results

✔ Accuracy: 80%+
✔ Clean and readable Jupyter Notebook
✔ Updated dataset fields for a streaming service use-case
✔ Confusion matrix + classification report
✔ Reproducible on any computer

This project showcases how a simple ML model can become powerful when combined with thoughtful feature engineering and clear presentation.
